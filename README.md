# BlockLists

A combination of personnally curated invasive domains and subdomains to block

This started off as a personal hobby in a way due to numerous readings of academic journals, reports, and quite a few books. However, then I started to see what was happening to me personally and when I set up a few different firewalls, as well as monitored ingoing and outgoing requests from my phones and other devices, the daily number at one point was 15,000 and then close to 200,000 hits in a week I almost freaked out. 


I decided I would try out my first original repository with the sole purpose of providing comprehensive lists for those out there who are sick of big data and relentless privacy invasion. It's not a cure but it sure as hell beats just letting it happen! I'll update it as often as I can, and take any and all requests. 


It is entirely up to you to choose which, if any, you want to implement. Some things added, for instance some of the googleapis, will render certain apps provided by google i.e. Google Translate, useless. So pay attention. You could disable one domain and enable the rest, or just not add it. Entirely your choice.


I will also attach my first Python script I used for some of these lists as well.
